# Random Quote Generator
This project makes an api call on load of the window to the forismatic api and retrieves a random quote with its corresponding author. When the **New Quote** has been clicked, a new call to the forimatic api will be made and a random quote with its author will appear on the screen, and you will have the option to share this quote on twitter. Additionally, every request made by clicking the **New Quote** button the background color will randomly change.
